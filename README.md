As we can see from the chart above the Urban Fares were the highest revenue producing followed by Suburban and lastly Rural.
The dollar ranges for each city type were Urban:$2500-above $1500; Suburban: $1500 -well above $500; Rural: $500 to just above $0.

From the table we can see that the increase in revenue is due to the increase in the amount of total rides in the respective city types. 
Drivers in Rural areas appear to receive much higher fares than Urban driver's however they receive far fewer rides. 

## Summary
Recommendation 1: I would encourage more driver's in urban cities to venture out into surrounding Rural areas to receive higher fares for less driving.

Recommendation 2: I would lower the fares in rural areas to encourage more booked rides and generate higher total revenue

Recommendation 3: I would perform surge hours in Suburban areas to encourage more Urban driver's to venture into the suburbs for rides to equalize supply and demand.
